This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl related to the unpredictable order of hash iteration using the `each` function. The `bug.pl` file contains code exhibiting this issue, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  Understanding the limitations of `each` and using alternative approaches for order-sensitive hash iteration is crucial for writing robust Perl code.
